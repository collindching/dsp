[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

#### Investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others using Cohen's d

The question asks us to analyze the effect size of being a first-born on a newborn weight, and compare that to the effect size of being a first-born on pregnancy length. In this case, we're using Cohen's d as the effect size, which compares difference between groups in terms of standard deviations.
